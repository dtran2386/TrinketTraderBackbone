day 27 homework extended into the weekend. Trinket Trader

- Please install gulp and gulp-browserify.
- I succesfully implemented a backbone structure.
- I couldn't figure out how to include auto-trade in a backbone structure, so I just left it in my app.js file. 
- Transaction log only works on manual button clicks, gets weird with auto-trade(continuous buying, even though 'coins' funds are low/not enough).
- Also, with the transaction log, whenever 'buy 5' or 'sell 5' button is clicked, it doesn't log the  amount, it logs the 'else' return statement instead in its place.
- Tried, but was not able to use Chart.js to create a stats chart.
